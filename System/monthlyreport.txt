Last Month’s Activities
The employee may include a short recap of what he has done during the past month to show the continuity of his work or his developments. He may also note here some of pending
 tasks from the previous month, as a background on what he accomplished for the reporting month.

Accomplishments for the Month
This is, probably, the most important section of the monthly progress report as it provides the substance of the report.

Plans for the Next Month
It is also useful to provide information on what an employee intends to accomplish in the following month.

Issues and Concerns
Any problems impeding an employee’s progress should be made known to his supervisors, and a section on it in the progress report is an excellent venue for such.
